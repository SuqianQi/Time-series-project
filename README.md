Research Question: How the Russian invasion of Ukraine affects the US economy

Background: On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine

Data:
Detrend all variables with Hamilton(2018), deseasonalized wth p=36 and h=12.
We decide to arrange the data in this order:
1.Industrial Production growth rate(Y), Unemployment rate(U), Gas price(P); 2.federal funds rate(I); 3.S&P500 Index(S); 4.uncertainty(uncern).
First Russia declared the invasion or invaded Ukraine, and uncertainty emerged. Then the stock market immediately reacted to this information. Then the Western country banned the sales of gas and derivatives from Russia and the US government adjusted the federal funds rate for these actions. Finally, the US economy reacted to all these changes reflected by the unemployment rate and production and gas price.
